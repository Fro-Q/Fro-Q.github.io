I am :rb[froQ] :rt[frog (probably].

I'm doing a graduate degree, which is not the point.
What matters is the code—building for the web (Vue, Nuxt, TypeScript),
crafting tools ([headup.nvim](https://github.com/Fro-Q/headup.nvim),
[VSCode theme LiG](https://github.com/Fro-Q/vscode-theme-LiG)),
obsessing over workflows (macOS + sketchybar + yabai + Hammerspoon + and shit).
I run a [blog](https://froq.me) and a [podcast](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/68fb1be73ffa38fac58d6bf2) called ToQ.

I read :rb[Camus] :rt[Albert Camus] and :rb[Sartre] :rt[Jean-Paul Sartre] on
absurdism, :rb[Cioran] :rt[Emil Cioran] on
nihilism, :rb[Freud] :rt[Sigmund Freud] and :rb[Lacan] :rt[Jacques Lacan] on
the unconscious.
I try to observe from the space between reason and feeling.

I have bipolar Ⅱ  disorder.
My thoughts swing between order and chaos.
That tension fuels whatever creativity I have.

Observer / Builder / Thinker

The goal: :u[become a full-time open source developer]{.text-amber-500}.
Right now, I'm still balancing on the wire.

This isn't just a blog.

[Post](/posts/en/)
is some writing I want you to read,
[Corpus](http://localhost:5173/corpus) tracks how knowledge grows and decays,
[Dashboard](http://localhost:5173/dashboard) is what I look at all day
(feel free to peek).
