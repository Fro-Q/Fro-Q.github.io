What is Corpus?

[A place to watch knowledge grow, decay, and recombine]{.text-rose-600.dark:text-rose-400.underline}.

This isn't a gallery. It tracks how information gets ingested, digested, fermented.
How I **read, hesitate, think, interrogate myself**.
If you care about where ideas come from and how they connect,
you'll probably know me better here than in [posts](/posts/).

Corpus isn't a neutral "knowledge base."
It's more like a dissection room, or a petri dish.
What makes it to [posts](/posts/) is just the occasional specimen from these dishes
that's barely presentable enough to exhibit.
